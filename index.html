      <h2 class = "setup-titles"><strong> 1. FINDING THE RIGHT LOCATION </strong></h2>
      <p class = "text"> It's very important when setting up a projector that you consider
        the location you are putting it in. <br> A projector works <strong> best in dark rooms </strong> and should preferably be projecting against a
        <strong> flat white wall. </strong><br> If you are willing to spend a bit of extra money on a screen
        to project onto, <strong> it can increase image quality and brightness </strong>, so it is highly recommended </p>
  <!-- STEP ONE -->

  <img src= "projector1.jpg" alt="projector in the dark on white wall" />
  <!-- STEP TWO -->
  <h2 class = "setup-titles"><strong> 2. FINDING THE RIGHT HEIGHT </strong></h2>
  <p class = "text"> There are a few ways to mount a projector, with the most common being:</p>
  <ul class = "text">
    <li> Mounted on a table in front of the user </li>
    <li> Mounted high on the wall behind the user </li>
    <li> Mounted hanging from the ceiling </li>
  </ul>
  <p class = "text"> The simplest and safest way of mounting is on a table in front,
    so this is the method we recommend. <br> Generally the height that the projector is positioned
    at is the same height as the bottom of the projection (assuming it is flat on a table) </p>
  <h2 class = "setup-titles"><strong> 3. PLUGGING IT IN </strong></h2>
  <p class = "text"> There is likely only 3 potential cables you would need to plug into your projector. </p>
  <ol class = "text">
    <li> The power cable for the projector </li>
    <li> The cable for a disk reader if you want one </li>
    <li> The HDMI cable from your laptop or desktop </li>
